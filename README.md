# FAQ

Why aren't MacOS, iOS, and iPadOS currnetly supported?

MacOS, iOS, and iPadOS are not currently supported because Apple is mean and requires a Mac for development of apps on these platforms. In addition, it is hard to distribute apps to iOS and iPadOS without going through the App Store, which costs $200/year.

Why isn't GNU/Linux Supported(Debian, Ubuntu, BunsenLabs, Linux Mint, Manjaro)?

I simply have not had the experience of making an app for Linux yet. If you would like to help me, please email rockindrew1+linux-development@gmail.com
